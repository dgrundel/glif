## Editing Palettes

- Do not change any palette file or palette keys without explicitly aligning all dependent masks/sprites and confirming with the user.
- If a palette error occurs, fix it by adjusting the palette minimally or by updating the masks—never by ad‑hoc palette edits alone.

## Selecting and Using Colors

- Avoid directly creating colors using `grid.Style`. Prefer loading colors from a palette. Confirm with the user before directly creating colors.
