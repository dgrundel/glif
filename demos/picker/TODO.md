This demo is an RGB color picker. The interface (as shown in EXAMPLE.md) is navigated using up/down arrows to select a color bar (red, green, or blue) and left/right arrows to decrease/increase the value for the selected the color. A triangle is shown next to the currently selected color bar (in EXAMPLE.md, green is currently selected). The color bar graphically displays the value for the respective color, and a number from 0-255 (representing the actual numeric color value) is displayed to the right of each bar. To the far right is a large color swatch that displays the mixed color. Below the swatch is the hex color value for the mixed color.
