This demo will be a simple blackjack game.

When the demo is first opened, the "splash" sprite is displayed on screen with a prompt to "press enter to continue". When enter is pressed, the splash disappears and the game begins.

During the game, graphical cards are displayed for the dealer and player, and the player chooses actions from a menu that can be navigated with up/down arrow keys and enter to select. This interface is shown in EXAMPLE.md.
